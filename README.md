Here is my hands-on approach to introducing Scala to you.

The sequence of information and examples here has been hand-crafted based on various tutorials.

## History
* 2003 <a href="#Odersky">"Martin Odersky</a> releases Version 1.0 of Scala. 
* 2011 TypeSafe's Reactive Platform provides commercial support.
* 2014 version 2.10.4
* 2016 Feb 22 Typesafe changes name to ![Lightbend](http://www.lightbend.com/)

## Why Scala?
The name Scala is derived from "scalable language".

The extent of Twitter's adoption of Scala are:

   * https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/
     started as lectures at Twitter.

   * http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/
     Effective Scala lists "best practices" for Scala at Twitter. 
     Useful for understanding idioms in Twitter's code.

Scala is also said to power The Guardian (UK), Wallmart, Sony, Huffington Post, etc. 

Agencies/consultants working with Scala:

## What is Reactive?

On September 16, 2014, Typesafe published their 
![Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)
which asked readers to sign the manifesto as a commitment to build "Reactive"
system with a more "coherant" appoach to systems that 
have thiese characteristics:

   * Responsive - responds in a timely manner
   * Resilient - responsive in the face of failure
   * Elastic - stays responsive under varying workload
   * Message Driven - rely on asynchronous message-passing that ensures loose coupling, isolation, location transparency, and provides the means to delegate errors as messages.

Concise and expressive coding mean less liability and more legibility.

Symbols as methods.

## Installation
0. Instead of download from scala-lang.org/download/

   ```
brew install scala --with-docs
   ```

   This put scala in this folder by default:

   ```
/usr/local/Cellar/scala/2.9.2
   ```

0. Verify:

   ```
scala -version
   ```

   The response:

   ```
Scala code runner version 2.9.2 -- Copyright 2002-2011, LAMP/EPFL
   ```

Scala compiles to Java, enabling it to use JRE, JVM.

### Typesafe Activator
On a Mac:

   ```
brew install typesafe-activator
   ```

   Its default port is 8888.


### IDE Choices Install 

0. Click Install one  the Scala IDEs
0. Scala-ide.org is based on Eclipse (version 12.03).


## Interactive
0. Open a Terminal command line window.
0. Invoke the scala run-time console REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop), Scala's interactive shell

   ```
scala
   ```

0. Press Tab key for a list of all keywords and variables.

   NOTE: Auto-completion of possbilities and auto-fill.

   NOTE: With Scala, a variable can be a function.

0. Print Hello World

   ```
println("Hello world");
   ```

   NOTE: Semicolons ("ugly cockroaches") are used only with multiple verbs on same line.

   NOTE: Everything returns something (all Scala code is <strong>expression based</strong>).

0. Quit back to bash console (like in vim):

   ```
:q
   ``` 

## Variables

0. Define a string variable:

   ```
var hello : String = "Hello world";
   ```

   NOTE: All Scala values in value variables that cannot be changed (immutable).

0. Define function:

   ```
def someFunc(a1:SomeType,...):SomeReturnType = {
}

def boolToInt(value : Boolean) =if(value) 1 else "0"
   ```

## SBT (Simple Build Tool)
SBT comes with Scala core, based on Maven:

Under src are main and test.

Under main are java, resources, and scala.

Under test are java, resources, and scala.

0. Create a folder with a .scala file.

   ```
mkdir HelloWorld && cd Helloworld
git init
copy con HelloWorld.scala
   ```

   A template creates:

   ```
class Main{
   def sayHi() = println("Hello")
}
   ```

0. Build it

   ```
sbt
   ```

   The command prompt

   ```
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignore option MaxPermSize=256m; 
port was removed in 8.0
   ```

   NOTE: The Scala compiler (scalac) was written by author of the Java compiler.

0. Use the console task:

   ```
console
   ```

  The response:

  Welcome to Scala version 2.10.3

### Define a build file
0. In bash command-line console within the custom program folder:

   ```
touch build.sbt
start build.sbt
   ```

0. Create a project folder.

0. Edit build.properties:

   ```
name := "Hello"
version := "0.1"
scalaVersion:= "2.10.4"
   ```

0. Edit plugins.sbt for use with Eclipse IDE:

   ```
addSbtPlugin("com.typsafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.4.0")
   ```

0. Invoke to create scaffolding:

   ```
sbt eclipse
   ```

0. In Eclipse, specify the workspace:

   PROTIP: Use folder ws or something short to differentiate among projects.

0. Create a <strong>Scala Worksheet</strong>. ???



## ScalaTest Styles
Test classes extends a test style class from
among http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/selecting_a_style

   * For xUnit, there is FunSuite.
   * For BDD, FlatSpec.
   * For RSpec lovers, there is FlatSuite.
   * For Acceptace testers, FeatureSuite.

After selection, test packages should appear among Refer

and clone https://github.com/scalameter/scalameter.git 
and https://github.com/scalameter/scalameter-examples

Among ![Alex's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoyqnhi_BdpLrBVMvkNIMMw) 
is [this one showing JVM GC profile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHCeXdxkx70)

## Scala is a New Paradigm from Java


   ```
m map { t ==> val (s, i) = t; (s, i+1) } 
   ```

   with "Sytactic sugar" removed to Java map function:

   ```
m.map({ t ==> val (s, i) = t; (s, i+1) })
   ```

A Tuple is a fixed list which can be typed differently and
can be a container f
or other data types.
Since Sashmi and Onigiri are instances of the same type Sushi:

   ```
val bento:(Sushi, Sushi) = (new Sashimi, new Onigiri)
   ```

Arity of 22 

Scala thus is able to identify issues at compile time.

### Traits like an abstract class - 
A trait can be added to any Scala class.

Like interfaces with implementations or controlled multiple inheritance.

According to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_%28computer_programming%29
"traits are a set of methods that can be used to extend the functionality of a class."

https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/basics.html
says "Traits are collections of fields and behaviors that you can extend or mixin to your classes." and offers this code example which extends traits using keywords:

   ```
class BMW extends Car with Shiny {
  val brand = "BMW"
  val shineRefraction = 12
}
   ```

   The above is dependent upon these definitions:

   ```
trait Car {
  val brand: String
}

trait Shiny {
  val shineRefraction: Int
}

class BMW extends Car {
  val brand = "BMW"
}
   ```

A class can extend only one class, but
a class can extend several traits. 


## Case Classes
A case in front of a class definition makes it a factory method
which creates getter classes:

   ```
case SomeClass(arg1:String)
   ```

With Scala, a companion object is where static objects are defined.

## Pattern Matching

## Tests

   ```
package X

class X extends FlatSpec{

}
   ```

import org.salatest.FlatSpec

## Run Tests
The tilde prefix detects if code changed and runs:

   ```
~test
   ```
